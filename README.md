This project is aimed at addressing the growing environmental concerns surrounding
forever chemicals, specifically PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances), which are notorious
for their persistence in the environment. These substances, found in everything from household
items to industrial products, pose a significant challenge due to their resistance to natural
breakdown processes. The projectâ€™s goal is to develop effective methods for breaking down
PFAS and similar forever chemicals, while recovering valuable fluorine for reuse in various
industries. The project follows a modular approach, beginning with the registration and approval
of teams by the admin. Once approved, teams analyze materials to identify the percentage of
PFAS and fluorine present. The next phase involves calculating the moles of C-F bonds, which
are critical in understanding the structure of these resilient chemicals. Teams also analyze the
energy required to break these bonds efficiently. The focus then shifts to recovery, where the
efficiency of fluorine recovery is measured. In the final module, teams evaluate the purification
of the recovered fluorine, using advanced algorithms like DecisionTreeRegressor to improve the
accuracy of the analysis. By breaking down these forever chemicals, the project aims to reduce
environmental harm while recovering essential resources. It represents a critical step forward in
the fight against long-lasting pollutants, promoting both environmental sustainability and
industrial innovation.
